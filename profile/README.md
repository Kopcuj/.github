# Kopcuj
Kopcuj web app focuses on getting track of your climbed hills in České středohoří. Mark your hills as climbed and rate them with stars. You can report an issue on the path or discuss topics on the discussions page.

# Information
Initial development started in summer 2020. Since then I solo developed this app. I learned a lot starting with JQuery till now with React. I decided, that I want to include this project in my seminar work in school.
If you want to try out this project feel free to do so.
